Added documentation regarding communication protocols, commands, response codes, component statuses and configuration parameters.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 5.15
* ts_idl
* IDL file for Dome from ts_xml 4.8

v0.1.0
======

First release of the Dome CSC and simulator.

This version already includes many useful things:

* A functioning Dome CSC which accepts all Dome Commands defined in ts_xml
* A functioning mock controller which accepts all JSON-style commands sent by the Dome CSC
* Functioning basic mock Lower Level Components which report their statuses. The following functionality has been implemented:

  * Azimuth rotation: simulates moving and crawling by taking into account the velocity parameters. No acceleration is simulated.
  * Aperture shutter: simulates instantaneous opening and closing.
  * Louvers: simluates instantaneous opening and closing.
  * Light and Wind Screen: simulates moving and crawling by taking into account the velocity parameters. No acceleration is simulated.
  * Interlock Monitoring: only reports a status.
  * Temperature regulation: simulates instantaneous setting of the temperature
